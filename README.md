#### My Bookshelf 
---
This is a application written in python that uses Google's API to collect data on books in my personal library given an ISBN number. The user can choose to add single books to the collection or perform a batch lookup by providing a csv file of ISBNs.

I use Flask to deploy a web-based application to display book thumbnails in a grid, each one having its own page that displays information about the book. A work in progress! 

The current release is availible here:
